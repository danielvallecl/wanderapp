r completely overwrites and a appends and adds information.

aFile = File.new('input.txt', 'r+')     r+ gives read, write and append access and created a file if it doesn't previously exist.
if aFile
   aFile.syswrite("ABCDEF")
   aFile.each_byte {|ch| putc ch; putc ?. }
else
   puts "Unable to open file!"
end
